### my dotfiles, including:
* distribution specific branches
* ***bonus surprise*** instances of unnecessarily Debian specific stuff interspersed in [branch:master](https://github.com/awaxa/dotfiles/tree/master "github:awaxa/dotfiles/tre]e/master") rather than [branch:debian](https://github.com/awaxa/dotfiles/tree/debian "github:awaxa/dotfiles/tree/debian") that has no effect on non-Debian systems as far as I've noticed
